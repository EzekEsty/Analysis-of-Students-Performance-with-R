The above project is the analysis of students' performance using the R programing. Functions such as the ggplot, dplyr, mututate, filter, select and more were used in the analysis.  The dataset contains the following colunmns: students_id, gender, race_ethnicity, parental_education_status, lunch, test_preparation_course, math_score, reading_score and writing_score. I carried out some exploratory data analysis. Results from the analysis showed that there was a very good performance. About 474 students had an excellent performance, 430 had a credit credit pass, 86 had a pass and 10 failed. For deeper insight, I created a new variable named Average_ Score and analysis was done based on gender and performance status and it was discovered that about 275 female students had an excellent performance, 199 male students performed excellently, 223 male students had a credit pass, 207 female students had a credit pass, 56 male students had a pass, 30 female students had a pass. Finally, 6 female students failed and 4 male students failed. Different charts such as bar charts, histogram and box plot were plotted. Feel free to click on the project for more.
